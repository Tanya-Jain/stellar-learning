The aim of the project was to develop a mobile application for ASET ALiAS, the technical club cum community of Amity University, Noida's Computer Science and Engineering department. After testing water from the surface of Java, Kivy in Python, django-for-android in python, hybrid and native app development, the project was finally chosen to be cross-platform based native mobile application. This application would hence be able to be easily extended to the users of both iOS and Android just by building the main source code in XCode in a Mac system for iOS and Android Studio in any system for Android.\par \medskip

Many might ask the need to develop an app for a community, but it seemed to be a need due to the growing size of community that made the need for a common ground for dissemination of all the necessary and relevant information. Mobile applications are a great way to stay connected to an organization's user-base, be the organization small-scaled or large-scaled. Mobile applications has also brought in the benefit to stay updated to news which one may or may not get to know if one stays relied to the age old way of using posters. Posters also display limited information used to appear catchy to a person irrespective of the reader understanding it or not. This problem can be overcome by mobile application providing in depth information about a particular topic or event.
