This project was a result of a great deal of support both moral and intellectual, I received from people around me. First of all I would like to thank the Almighty for blessing me with the determination required to successfully complete this in-house training project. I'm grateful to Facebook for developing React Native that has changed how mobile applications are created significantly and my friend Omkar Yadav, who has introduced me to this technology. I am also thankful to my faculty advisor Mrs Divya Misra for her faith in my capabilities. I extend my sincere gratitude to the respected Head of the Institute, Dr. Abhay Bansal (Jt.Head-ASET, Jt.Head-ASE and DICET) and my respected programme leader, Mrs Shipra Saraswat. I extend my thanks to the highly experienced programmers on \#javascript. I also place on record, my sincere gratitude to one and all, who directly or indirectly, have lent their helping hand in this venture.
