This project was a result of a great deal of support both moral and intellectual, I received from people around me. First of all I would like to thank the Almighty for blessing me with the determination required to successfully complete the term paper. I'm grateful to Mr Chris Stucchio for giving a talk on Bayesian statistics in the PyDelhi COnference 2017, which has introduced me to this insightful topic. I am also thankful to my faculty advisor Ms Sangeeta Rani for her faith in my capabilities. I extend my sincere gratitude to the respected Head of the Institute, Dr. Abhay Bansal (Jt.Head-ASET, Jt.Head-ASE and DICET) and my respected programme leader, Dr Tanupriya Choudhary. I extend my thanks to the highly experienced programmers on \#python IRC channels. I also place on record, my sincere gratitude to one and all, who directly or indirectly, have lent their helping hand in this venture.
