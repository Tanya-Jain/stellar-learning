Bayesian statistics has a long road ahead for development. There is an intensive scope for expansion both in terms of efficiency and features, even in Bayesian A/B testing. The enumerated list given below is an attempt to document the future scopes that bayesian statistic has:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Immune to peeking}: Bayesian insights are helpful in test settings since you can stop a test at whatever point you please and the outcomes will in any case be substantial.
\item \textbf{Revenue is the goal}:The final objective is to max income and different business measurements, yet there is no better approach to do that in the domain of A/B testing than to find target realities about the world the business works in, as most ideal as essentially.
\item \textbf{Answers are given to questions of interest}: Bayesian methodologies are intended to give the response to what is the likelihood of Variant A being superior to the Control given a few information and our earlier learning about Variant A and the Control?
\end{enumerate}
